### All user stories:
### Navigation and structure
- __Main navigation:__ As a __Site User__, I can __always see the main navigation options on the top of the page,__ so that I can __easily and intuitively find my way around the website__.
- __404 page:__ As a __Site User__ I can __see an informative 404 page guiding me back to the main page if I visit a page that does not exist by mistake__ so that I can __easily get back to the home page with minimal disruption.__
- __Favicon:__ As a __Site User__ I can __see the website's favicon__ so that I can __easily find the website if I have multiple tabs open__.

### Accounts/Login
- __Account registration:__ As a __Site User__, I can __register an account with a username and password__ so that I can __like art pieces, make enquiries, and set up a gallery.__
- __Account login:__  As a __registered Site User__, I can __log in__ so that I can __fully engage with the platform, by e.g. posting art or making enquiries__.
- __Account logout:__ As a __Logged in User__, I can __log out__ so that I can __feel safe in that others cannot access my credentials.__
- __Clear registration and login process:__ As a __Site User__, I can see __clear instructions, get feedback and/ confirmation__ when using the forms to register/log in/log out, so that I can __sign up/log in without unnecessary problems and enjoy the experience.__
