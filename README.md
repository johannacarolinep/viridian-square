### All user stories:
### Epics
1. Navigation and structure
2. Accounts/Login
3. Showcasing art

### Navigation and structure
- `Main navigation:`  As a __Site User__, I can __always see the main navigation options on the top of the page,__ so that I can __easily and intuitively find my way around the website__.
- `404 page:` As a __Site User__ I can __see an informative 404 page guiding me back to the main page if I visit a page that does not exist by mistake__ so that I can __easily get back to the home page with minimal disruption.__
- `Favicon:` As a __Site User__ I can __see the website's favicon__ so that I can __easily find the website if I have multiple tabs open__.

### Accounts/Login
- `Account registration:` As a __Site User__, I can __register an account with a username and password__ so that I can __like art pieces, make enquiries, and set up a gallery.__
- `Account login:`  As a __registered Site User__, I can __log in__ so that I can __fully engage with the platform, by e.g. posting art or making enquiries__.
- `Account logout:` As a __Logged-in User__, I can __log out__ so that I can __feel safe in that others cannot access my credentials.__
- `Clear registration and login process:` As a __Site User__, I can see __clear instructions, and get feedback and/or confirmation__ when using the forms to register/login/log out, so that I can __sign up/log in without unnecessary problems and enjoy the experience.__

### Showcasing art
- `Creating art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **create an art piece, including an image and details (e.g., title)**, so that I can **showcase my art.**
- `Updating art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **update my own art piece**, so that I can **manage my own content**.
- `Deleting art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **delete my own art piece**, so that I can **manage and be in control of my own content.**
- `CRUD collections`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **create, update and delete collections**, so that I can **group related art pieces and present my art in a way that makes sense to me.**
- `Adding tags to art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **add tags to my own art piece**, so that I can **increase the searchability of my art**.
