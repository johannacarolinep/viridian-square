### Navigation and structure
- `Main navigation:`  As a __Site User__, I can __always see the main navigation options on the top of the page,__ so that I can __easily and intuitively find my way around the website__.
- `404 page:` As a __Site User__ I can __see an informative 404 page guiding me back to the main page if I visit a page that does not exist by mistake__ so that I can __easily get back to the home page with minimal disruption.__
- `Favicon:` As a __Site User__ I can __see the website's favicon__ so that I can __easily find the website if I have multiple tabs open__.

### Accounts/Login
- `Account registration:` As a __Site User__, I can __register an account with a username and password__ so that I can __like art pieces, make enquiries, and set up a gallery.__
- `Account login:`  As a __registered Site User__, I can __log in__ so that I can __fully engage with the platform, by e.g. posting art or making enquiries__.
- `Account logout:` As a __Logged-in User__, I can __log out__ so that I can __feel safe in that others cannot access my credentials.__
- `Clear registration and login process:` As a __Site User__, I can see __clear instructions, and get feedback and/or confirmation__ when using the forms to register/login/log out, so that I can __sign up/log in without unnecessary problems and enjoy the experience.__

### Showcasing art
- `Creating art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **create an art piece, including an image and details (e.g., title)**, so that I can **showcase my art.**
- `Updating art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **update my own art piece**, so that I can **manage my own content**.
- `Deleting art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **delete my own art piece**, so that I can **manage and be in control of my own content.**
- `CRUD collections`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **create, update and delete collections**, so that I can **group related art pieces and present my art in a way that makes sense to me.**
- `Adding tags to art pieces`: As a **logged-in user**, I can **add tags to my own art piece**, so that I can **increase the searchability of my art**.

### Discovering art
- `Viewing an artist's profile/gallery page`: As a **Site User**, I can **visit an artist's profile page/gallery page**, so that I can **view all art pieces and collections published by the artist in one place.**
- `Viewing popular/trending art pieces`:  As a **Site User**, I can **see popular/trending art pieces in a dedicated section on the discovery page** so that **I can get inspired to engage further and discover new great pieces.**
- `Searching for art pieces`: As a **Site User**, I can **search based on artist, title, collection title, and tags**, so that I can **find art pieces matching my criteria.**
- `Infinite scrolling for listed art pieces`: As a **Site User viewing a large number of art pieces in a list, the list is shown using infinite scroll**, so that **I do not need to navigate to separate pages**.
- `Filtering art pieces`: As a **Site User**, I can **filter the art pieces in a list view** so that I can **more easily find the pieces I am looking for and narrow down the results.**
- `Sorting art pieces`: As a **Site User**, I can **sort the art pieces in a list view (search results)** so that I can **more easily find the pieces I am looking for.**
- `Viewing art piece collection`: As a **Site User viewing an individual art piece**, I can **see if the art piece belongs to a collection**, so that I can **easily find art pieces similar to the one I am viewing.**
- `Viewing a single art piece`: As a **Site User**, I can **click on an art piece in a list** so that I can **see a detailed view of the art piece.**

### Liking art pieces
- `Liking an art piece`: As a **logged-in site user**, I can **like an art piece**, so that I can **show appreciation to the artist and so that I can more easily find my way back to art pieces I enjoy.**
- `Removing a like from an art piece`: As a **logged-in site user who has liked an art piece**, I can **remove my like**, so that I can **change my mind or correct my mistake.**
- `Viewing liked art pieces`:  As a **logged-in site user**, I can **visit the “Liked” page**, so that I can **view all art pieces that I have liked.**
